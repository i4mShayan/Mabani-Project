## Important informations
1) program has worked fine with c++ 11
<br>
2) file paths given to fstream works for windows.however it may not work in linux distributions/mac os.
if you got file errors, just delete ".\\data\\" from every fstream file openings and 
in working directory(where the program is) make 3 files with names of:
1. players.txt
2. players_points.txt
3. saved_games_count.txt

and finally it should work fine :)
